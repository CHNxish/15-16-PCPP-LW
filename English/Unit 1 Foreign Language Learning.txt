$Learning a Foreign Language

    There are many ways to learn a foreign language well! Read the suggestions below.
Following these steps will give you a firm foundation.
    1)Spend time
    By far the most important factor is how much time you are immersed in the language. The
more time you spend on the language,the faster you will learn. This means listening, reading,
writing and speaking. It does not mean sitting in class looking out of the window, or listening to
other student who do not speak well, or expecting explanations in your own language about
how the language works. It means spending time enjoyably on whatever relates to the language
you are learning.
    2)Listen and read every day
    Wherever you are, listen to the language on your MP3 player and read what you are
listening to. Listen to and read materials that you like, materials that you can mostly understand,
or even only partly understand. If you keep listening and reading, you will get used to the
langauge. One hour of listening and reading each day is more effctive than many hours of
class time.
	3)Focus on words and phrases
	Build up your vocabulary. You'll need lots. Start to notice words and how they come together
as phrases. Learn these words and phrases through listening and reading. Read online, using online
dictionaries, and make your own vocabulary lists for review. Soon you will run into your new
words and phrases elsewhere. Gradually you will be able to use then. Do not worry about how
accurately you speak until you have accumulated plenty of words through listening and reading.
	4)Take responsibility for your own learning
	If you do not want to learn the language, you won't. If you do want to learn the language,
take control. Choose content that interests you, that you want to linsten to and read. Look up
the words and phrases that you need in order to understand your listening and reading. Do not
wait for someone else to show you the language or tell you what to do. Discover the language
bu yourself, like a child growing up.Talk when you feel like it. Write when you feel like it. A
teacher cannot teach you to become fluent, but you can learn to become fluent if you want to.
	5)Relax and enjoy yourself
	Do not worry about what you cannot remember, or cannot yet understand, or cannot yet
say. It does not matter. You are learning and improving. The language will gradually become
clearer, but this will happen at a pace that you cannot control. So sit back and enjoy. Above all,
make sure you spend enough time with the language. That is the greatest guarantee of success.
